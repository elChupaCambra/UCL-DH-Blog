Our blog is up and running!

Posts on here thanks to the magic of Markdown, which you can learn more about [here.](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Images should be uploaded to a folder within the ['images'](https://github.com/elChupaCambra/UCL-DH-Blog/tree/main/images) folder of this repo, corresponding to your post. The image below is an example of this!

Check out this cute lil' corgo!!

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file, which can be found [here](https://github.com/elChupaCambra/UCL-DH-Blog/blob/main/_posts/2020-12-17-hello-world.md).
Shoot me a message on the DH discord channel if you have any questions!
